      <h3>Vast Size and Scale</h3>
      <p>Galaxy is one of the fundamental building blocks of the universe. It is a vast, gravitationally bound system comprising billions to trillions of stars, along with gas, dust, and other celestial objects. Galaxies come in various shapes and sizes, ranging from small dwarf galaxies to massive spiral and elliptical galaxies. The sheer scale of galaxies showcases the immense size and complexity of the universe.</p>

      <h3>Stellar Nurseries</h3>
      <p>Galaxies serve as stellar nurseries, where new stars are born. Within galaxies, regions of active star formation called nebulae or molecular clouds give rise to the formation of new stars. These clouds of gas and dust collapse under the influence of gravity, leading to the ignition of nuclear fusion and the birth of stars. The continuous cycle of stellar birth and death within galaxies contributes to the evolution and dynamics of these cosmic structures.</p>

      <h3>Gravitational Interactions</h3>
      <p>Galaxies interact and influence each other through gravitational interactions. Gravitational forces between galaxies can result in various phenomena such as galaxy mergers, tidal interactions, and the formation of galactic structures like spiral arms and bars. These interactions play a crucial role in shaping the evolution and morphology of galaxies over cosmic timescales. The study of galaxy interactions provides insights into the dynamics and formation of galaxies, as well as the large-scale structure of the universe.</p>
